### Remote destination path

Remote destination path. e.g. existing remote folder, where all files will be stored. ex. `/home/user/mysftpfolder/`

 `test_YYYYMMDDHHMiSS.csv`

 
# Development
 
This example contains runnable container with simple unittest. For local testing it is useful to include `data` folder in the root
and use docker-compose commands to run the container or execute tests. 

If required, change local data folder (the `CUSTOM_FOLDER` placeholder) path to your custom path:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./:/code
      - ./CUSTOM_FOLDER:/data
```

Clone this repository, init the workspace and run the component with following command:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org:kds_consulting_team/kds-team.wr-simple-sftp.git my-new-component
cd my-new-component
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm dev
```

Run the test suite and lint check using this command:

```
docker-compose run --rm test
```
